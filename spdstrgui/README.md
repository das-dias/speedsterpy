# Speedster GUI Package

This package holds the main *Graphical User Interface* framework for the visualization of integrated circuit layouts and back-annotation of extraction information directly on the layout.

The GUI is implemented through the use of the Kivy open-source API, written in Python, allowing for the fast development of complex and visually beautiful, cross-platform (desktop/modile) GUIs.

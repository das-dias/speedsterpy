# Speedster Net

Speedster Net is a powerful package allowing for the automatic extraction of circuit netlists only using the required layout information.

By providing either:

- Labelled polygons or
- Raw geometry information

The circuit netlists can be automatically extracted by using the developed algorithm.

This package also holds fundamental geometry operations over GDS information such as polygon boolean operations and fragmentation, allowing to construct the graphs for the transgression of charged carriers throughout all the highlighted nets.
